# React Console

> A basic console component written in React.

## Instructions

1. `npm install` or `yarn install`
1. `npm start`
1. Click in the window and start typing!

## Notes

This is an early prototype. Since the whole codebase may be overturned at any point I have avoided testing and worrying too heavily about code cleanliness and proper abstration. The goal here is an MVP which will be the seed for another, better and tested, implementation to be written from scratch.
